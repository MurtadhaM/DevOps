Cisco Meraki PSK Rotator
John M. Kuchta .:|:.:|:.  https://github.com/TKIPisalegacycipher
Goals
* Generate random PSK
* Update one specific SSID's PSK 
* Email one specific address a notification of the change
If you plan to use Gmail's SMTP server, please consult https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600 before use.
There are a few caveats to using it, and you might have errors unless you follow the directions in that doc,
and update this code to use the settings that are right for your organization.
USAGE
Update the SMTP configuration to match your SMTP server
Update the Meraki dashboard configuration section to match your desired outcome
Update the password generator configuration to meet your complexity needs
Test in a test organization with test networks to confirm desired functionality
The rest is history!
